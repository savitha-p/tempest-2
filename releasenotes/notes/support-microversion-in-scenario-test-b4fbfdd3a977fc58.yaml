    Add microversion support for scenario tests. Scenario test calls
    multiple service API within same test and many services like compute,
    volume and placement etc support API microversion. With microversion
    support in scenario test, we can call different service API with
    different microvesion. Which means we can implement scenario tests
    for microversion also.
    Currently Scenario manager support below services microversion:

    * Compute
    * Volume
    * Placement
